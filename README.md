## My Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to get comfortable with thinking about the state of the app and updating the Views accordingly. In addition, I used logic to control the flow of the program. This is a challenge where I solidified my understanding of IF-ELSE statements and comparison operators.

## What I created

In this app, I created a “choose your own adventure” game similar to the App Store hit “Life Line” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience

This inspiration for this app came from the London App Brewery's iOS Development course.
